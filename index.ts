    text: "We reject this argument because section 5340 does not clearly impose a time requirement on when the billing by providers must occur. Rather, it can reasonably be read as requiring that, when billing does occur, it must be documented. Under the California system, provider billing of all third party liable resources was documented. Section 2089 of the California Medicaid Procedures Manual requires Regional Centers to bill insurance companies prior to seeking reimbursement from Medicaid for claims with other health coverage and requires them to maintain documentation of their efforts to recover third party reimbursement.California Ex. 43, Att. C. The fact that this billing and documentation occurs subsequent to California's claims for FFP for TCM services without other health coverage is not relevant to whether documentation occurs. Again, HCFA has focused on the timing of the billing and documentation process rather than the fact that California had a system for requiring billing as a prerequisite to claiming under Medicaid.Nor did the delay of some Regional Centers in billing third parties prejudice HCFA's legitimate interest in ensuring that states recover all possible third party reimbursement and that HCFA not participate in unnecessary costs. In this case, HCFA never disputed California's representation that its MEDS system eliminated claims with other health coverage from the federal claiming process until the Regional Centers completed their billing procedures. Therefore, not only did California's system satisfy all federal standards for cost avoidance systems, it also satisfied the purpose of those requirements: it excluded claims with potential health insurance coverage from the federal claiming process.Finally, while the majority of Regional Centers did not have functioning billing systems prior to the end of the disallowance period, the Regional Centers were not precluded from later billing for services which they had previously provided. In fact, this was required as a prerequisite for resubmitting a Medicaid claim. Information gathered by HCFA in the course of its review indicates that, after the end of the disallowance period, all of the Regional Centers either had billed or assured they would bill retroactively for services provided from July 1, 1988 for which other health coverage had been identified by the MEDS system. 11/ See HCFA Ex. AA and BB. For the preceding reasons, we conclude that, for all TCM services provided July 1, 1988 or after, California had established a cost avoidance system which satisfied applicable standards and prevented federal participation in costs which might be paid by insurance until providers had attempted to obtain such payment. Consequently, these services were not provided \"without charge.\"In order to compensate for its inability to identify and eliminate specific claims, California reduced the total units of TCM services provided by each of these four centers by 10%, a percent which it represented exceeded the units provided to recipients with other health coverage. State Ex. 55. It then multiplied the reduced number of units by the unit rate of each of the centers to calculate its FFP claim. Id.California's methodology for this period did not constitute seeking third party reimbursement and therefore these services were available \"without charge.\" California's third party reimbursement system is premised on the correlation of specific recipients with specific services and insurance coverage. The applicable requirements governing California's third party liability system do not contemplate reducing an FFP claim based on an estimate.The fact that California's inability to use its MEDS system to identify specific claims resulted from the length of time HCFA took to approve the amendment does not excuse California's inability to identify these claims. From almost the beginning of the amendment process, California program officials represented to HCFA that they would apply California's third party system to seek reimbursement for these costs. They knew or should have known that they could honor this representation only if they devised a way to retain the necessary information concerning other health coverage for individual TCM services. While a 10% reduction was a method for avoiding costs to the federal government, it was not a cost avoidance system meeting applicable state and federal requirements for seeking third party reimbursement.California argued that what California did should be viewed in the context of the real world, in which no health insurer is going to pay for TCM services in any event. California argued that the Board had recognized this in its prior decision, and that HCFA had acknowledged it to some extent by approving a plan amendment waiving cost avoidance in a slightly different context for other types of health services.As HCFA pointed out, however, with respect to the other health services mentioned by California, California had sought and obtained a waiver for application of a cost avoidance system. California did not do this with respect to TCM services, instead determining that TCM claims with other health coverage should be remitted to the Regional Centers for billing.Under a pay and recover system, the state pays the provider and then seeks reimbursement from the third party. Where probable existence of third party liability is established at the time a provider claim is filed, a state must use cost avoidance unless it has obtained a waiver from HCFA to use pay and recover. 42 C.F.R.  433.139(b). Where probable liability has not been established or benefits are not available at the time the claim is filed, a state may pay the provider and proceed itself against the third party. 42 C.F.R.  433.139(c).As part of its third party liability plan, California maintained a pay and recover system for seeking third party reimbursement when probable liability was not established or benefits were not available at the time the claim was filed. For TCM cases, this system involved recovery of TCM costs from tort-feasors and liability insurance companies.HCFA did not review California's pay and recover system. The parties faulted one another for the fact that HCFA did not review this part of California's system. California argued that it did not submit additional information because HCFA did not request it and therefore California had concluded that HCFA regarded the system as acceptable.We conclude that it is appropriate to consider California's pay and recover system in determining whether California sought third party reimbursement for these services. First, DAB No. 1285 made it clear that California's pay and recover system should be considered in whether TCM services were \"without charge.\" DAB No. 1285, at 15-19. Second, we do not read HCFA's requests for specific information from California as being directed to its pay and recover system. Moreover, HCFA was informed that the Board would consider California's pay and recover evidence prior to close of the record and prior to the final conference call in this case. HCFA did not offer contradictory evidence, did not request an opportunity to conduct a further review of California's system, and did not request a hearing in which to cross- examine California's declarants.DHS administers California's pay and recover system to recoup monies resulting from settlements and judgments obtained by Medi-Cal beneficiaries in personal injury actions. This system, or one essentially like it, has been in place since prior to the disallowance period. California Ex. 49, Declaration of Patricia A. Masuda, Chief of Personal Injury Unit, Third Party Liability Branch at 1. Pursuant to the system, DHS opens a recovery file on Medi-Cal beneficiaries whenever it has evidence of possible a possible personal injury action; determines through the Medi-Cal computer system how much Medi-Cal has paid on behalf of the recipient; files a Medi-Cal lien for these expenses; and recovers amounts to satisfy the lien. California Ex. 49, Third Party Liability Plan at 15.Prior to the submission of SPA 87-15, DHS operated this pay and recovery system pursuant to section 14124.71(a) of the California Welfare and Institutions Code. That statute provides that when Medi-Cal benefits have been or will be provided to a Medi-Cal recipient because of an injury for which another person is liable, or for which a carrier is liable, DHS may recover from the person or carrier the reasonable value of the benefits. While California maintained that this pre-existing statutory authority was sufficient to enable it to recover the costs of Medi-Cal TCM services (California Ex. 41), California supplemented its general mandate with statutory provisions specific to TCM services.In addition to amending its statutory authorization for its pay and recovery system, California included tort- feasor recovery in its inter-agency contracts between DHS and DDS. Section IV.I.1. of the 1987 contract provided that DHS would periodically review DDS' listing of TCM clients to identify cases with related tort actions and that Regional Centers were obligated to notify DDS of cases involving tort liability.California represented that it applied its pay and recover system to TCM costs by seeking to recover the costs of services to recipients with possible claims against third parties. State Ex. 49, Declaration at 1.Medicaid recipients with a DHS recovery file, the reports identify the recipient, the Regional Center providing the service, the charges, and the dates of service. The reports demonstrate that the TCM pay and recovery system was statewide, i.e., DHS received data and sought recovery for TCM services provided by all of the 21 Regional Centers.\"was in place during the disallowance period,\" we do not find this objection dispositive of whether these services were provided \"without charge.\" HCFA again focused on the timing of the final implementation rather tha",

    text: 'If you scrape your knee or break an arm, your body knows right what to do: make more skin or bone to replace the damaged tissue. But it\'s not that simple if what\'s hurt is your heart. When cardiac muscle is destroyed by a heart attack, cardiomyopathy, or other illness or injury, there are no replacement parts waiting in the wings.In some patients, a heart transplant or a mechanical device can help restore at least some of the lost function. But in most instances, the owner of the damaged heart is sentenced to a life of downward spiraling health as the surviving cells literally work themselves to death struggling to do the job of their fallen comrades. Soon, however, that picture may change. With the creation of the Center for Cardiovascular Repair (CCVR) at the University of Minnesota, the stage has been set for moving a revolutionary heart-mending strategy from the laboratory to real life.Known as cellular cardiomyoplasty, the approach involves infusing living cells from other parts of a person\'s body into his or her heart to restore lost function. This revolutionary approach has been shown to improve heart function in animals and has begun to be tested in humans, with encouraging preliminary results. The rigor of randomized clinical trials is next. CCVR director Doris Taylor should know better than just about anyone what promise this new technology has to offer. In 1998, Taylor led a research team at Duke University in North Carolina that published a paper showing improvement in the function of damaged heart tissue in rabbits after transplantation of leg muscle cells.  "All the pieces are in place here [at the U] to succeed," she says. Those pieces include a cadre of top-notch cardiologists and surgeons; the Stem Cell Institute, which offers opportunities to collaborate in exploring the use of adult stem cells for repairing not only heart but also vascular tissue; the Biomedical Engineering Institute, which can design almost anything we can imagine; the Lillehei Heart Institute; the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research; the Minnesota Molecular and Cellular Therapeutics Facility, which allows researchers to prepare cells under the rigorous conditions needed for human clinical trials; the local biomedical industry community; and what Taylor refers to as a "strong belief in innovation.""I was hired to be the catalyst," she says. "My job is to be a connector among the various aspects that are here and to really help bring together what might have seemed like disparate areas of research into a network, so that we can move ahead faster and better than anyone else and really be the place people think of when they think cardiovascular repair." To learn more about Doris Taylor, read "Hearty enthusiasm."Martha Rueter might have been spotted at cafes all across the Twin Cities the past three years, but she wasn\'t just sampling salads and sandwiches. Rueter, an associate professor of family social science, was meeting with community leaders to lay the groundwork for The Minnesota Diverse Families Project--an unprecedented study of what it takes for families to live a good life in a diverse Minnesota.Rueter is part of an interdisciplinary and multicultural research team from the College of Human Ecology--along with family social science colleagues Jean Bauer, Kathryn Rettig, William Turner, and Virginia Zuiker--that is probing what quality of life means to African American, American Indian, Asian American, and Hispanic families who call Minnesota home. Can a working-class Hispanic family living on the West Side of St. Paul enjoy as satisfying a quality of life as an affluent African American or Asian American family in southwest Minneapolis? How about an impoverished Native American family in Red Lake compared to a middle-class European American family in Bloomington? The answers probably are far from simple, suspects Rueter, who notes that "almost all quality-of-life assessment tools used today were developed to look at individuals, not families--and most were created by white researchers studying European Americans." "We have a lot of snapshot information about [overall] quality of life [in the state]," Rueter says. "[But] we know almost nothing about how quality of life is defined and experienced among minority racial and ethnic groups in Minnesota--even though the nonwhite population is now about 12 percent of our population and growing. And most important from a policy perspective, we don\'t know much about long-term quality of life [for those groups]--what improves or lessens it over time."What the researchers have learned, thus far, is that "the things traditionally associated with a high quality of life may not necessarily be in the same place on the list--or on the list at all--for families from nonmajority cultures," says Rueter.For example, "spiritual beliefs play a really important role in how [many ethnic] families experience quality of life," she explains. Among Southeast Asians, particularly the Hmong, "having a lot of children may be a more important indicator of quality of life than other indicators, such as income. Discrimination and other forms of oppression also may play a major role in shaping the quality-of-life experiences of minority families, she adds. For example, Native American community leaders describe "historical grief" as a likely impact on their quality-of-life perceptions. Once the researchers have established these significant quality-of-life components, they will conduct annual interviews with 25 families from each community to track "how and why families\' quality of life shifts over time, including the \'little things along the way\' that precipitate bigger shifts."Rueter says the study, "Tracking Changes in Quality of Life among Minnesota\'s Diverse Families," will help policymakers better meet the safety, health, and educational needs of the changing state population. The 2000 U.S. Census reports that Minnesota is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse, and the State Demographic Center projects that by 2020, Minnesota\'s minority populations will increase to 15 percent of the total population, up from 6.3 percent in 1990. To read the complete story about this project, which is part of the President\'s Interdisciplinary Academic Initiative on Children, Youth, and Families, see "Completing the Picture."Over the next several months, Minnesota legislators will decide on the state biennial budget, which will include funding for the University for the next two years. The state\'s budgeting process officially began with the release of Governor Tim Pawlenty\'s biennial budget proposal at the end of January. The University fared very well in the governor\'s recommendations, according to University officials. "We are pleased that the governor recognized the need for investment in the U and believe these recommendations are a good start.  Now we need to take our case to the legislature," said Mike Dean, coordinator of the U\'s Legislative Network.During the coming weeks, legislators will begin making decisions on how to fund the numerous organizations that receive state support. Many of these organizations will work to influence  the budget decisions through letter writing, e-mails, and phone calls. That is why University advocates are stepping up their efforts as well."State legislators like hearing from their constituents," says former state representative Donna Peterson, who is director of the government relations office at the U. "They want to know what\'s important to the people in their district, and how they can help with their concerns. Supporters or advocates can give those heart-warming, first-hand accounts that can help legislators decide which public entities are deserving of state funding and how much they should get."And that\'s what the University is counting on come Wednesday, February 23. For the past two years the University has hosted Maroon and Gold Day at the Capitol. The half-day event is an opportunity for University students, faculty, staff, alumni, and members of the public to demonstrate their support for the U, says Dean. Lions: another reason to visit the Capitol"The Lion\'s Mane," a new exhibit by the Bell Museum of Natural History featuring work by U researchers Craig Packer and Peyton West, will be on display at the Minnesota State Capitol from February 11 to 24. The exhibit includes one of the life-sized toy lions with interchangeable wigs that the researchers used to test the reactions of real lions to different lion mane sizes and colors."It\'s a day where University supporters can speak directly with legislators and see the legislative process at work," he says. "And this year, more than ever, speaking to legislators is important because the University cannot afford another round of budget cuts. Urging state leaders to reverse the trend of declining state support is key in maintaining a strong University for the state.To learn more about Maroon and Gold Day at the Capitol or to participate in the free activities, which will include a dinner at Coffman Union, see Legislative Network.For information about the University\'s capital and bonding requests, see www.umn.edu/govrel.He\'s been called a walking beer barrel, but Two-Ton Tony sure can punch.

    text: 'Reiterating his support for the troop "surge" to Iraq announced recently by President Bush, McCain said on NBC\'s "Meet the Press" that U.S. policy had produced Iraqi turmoil so bad that, if no change were made, "within months we would see a total breakdown in Iraq." The result, he said, would be ethnic cleansing between rival religious groups in the capital on the scale of that in Srebrenica, where Serbian military forces slaughtered 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in 1995."We can\'t expect Americans to sit outside Baghdad or outside the borders and watch such a thing go on," McCain said.While he said he preferred a larger troop buildup than the new 21,500-person deployment proposed by Bush, McCain said the new U.S. military commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, had assured him that if Petraeus "needed more, he would receive them."The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to take up resolutions on Iraq on Wednesday, some nonbinding and others that would cap the number of U.S. troops there or reduce future funding for American or Iraqi security forces.Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the committee and co-sponsor of a bipartisan, nonbinding resolution that would put senators on record as opposing Bush\'s plan, said votes on other approaches would not deliver a muddled message."There\'s an overwhelming . . . consensus that we should deescalate the war," he added during an appearance on "Fox News Sunday."Sen. Carl M. Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said on the same program, "It will be a very powerful message if a bipartisan majority of the Congress say that they disagree with the increased military involvement in Iraq." He added that could only be a first step: "If the president does not take heed to that step, at that point, you then consider another step."Levin warned, however, "The worst thing we can do is to vote on something which is critical of the current policy and lose it, because if we lose that vote, the president will use the defeat of a resolution as support for his policy."Unlike Petraeus, Casey has been privately skeptical about the wisdom of deploying five new brigades now. He argued last year that the presence of U.S. troops was fostering an unhealthy Iraqi dependency on foreign assistance. After publicly embracing Bush\'s plan, however, Casey said that it could make Baghdad residents begin to feel safe in their neighborhoods by the end of the summer.McCain retorted yesterday: "It\'s taken us nearly four years to get to this desperate situation we\'re in today. So to think that within three or four months or a short period of time that we could retrieve the situation, I think, is just foolishness."McCain has previously sought to deny military promotions to officers whose work in Iraq displeased him, including several associated with policies that he said had led to the abuse of U.S. military detainees there. While not promising outright to oppose Casey\'s appointment, he said, "I have hard questions to ask him, and I\'m very skeptical about it."Levin has said he is inclined to back Casey.Meanwhile, McCain faces opposition from some Republican lawmakers who disagree with his endorsement of the troop buildup.Among the members of the Foreign Relations Committee, according to Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), "I don\'t believe there was one Republican senator who came forward with any kind of enthusiasm or any kind of strong support of the president\'s plan.""The party that I first voted for on top of a tank in the Mekong Delta in 1968 is not the party I see today," Hagel said on CBS\'s "Face the Nation" yesterday.As for the nonbinding resolution, McCain called it "basically a vote of no confidence in the men and women we are sending over there."McCain, whom polls have shown running neck and neck among potential voters with newly announced Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, said yesterday that the senator from New York would make a "serious president." He did not reiterate his February 2005 comment that she would make a "good president."BAGHDAD, Jan. 21 -- The armored sport-utility vehicles whisked into a government compound in the city of Karbala with speed and urgency, the way most Americans and foreign dignitaries travel along Iraq\'s treacherous roads these days.Iraqi guards at checkpoints waved them through Saturday afternoon because the men wore what appeared to be legitimate U.S. military uniforms and badges, and drove cars commonly used by foreigners, the provincial governor said.Once inside, however, the men unleashed one of the deadliest and most brazen attacks on U.S. forces in a secure area. Five American service members were killed in a hail of grenades and gunfire in a breach of security that Iraqi officials called unprecedented.The attack, which lasted roughly 20 minutes, came on a day when the United States lost at least 20 other troops, including a dozen in a helicopter crash, making it the third most lethal day for American forces in Iraq.Meanwhile, the military announced the arrival of 3,200 troops of the 82nd Airborne Division\'s 2nd Brigade Combat Team, the first unit to reach Baghdad as part of a 21,500-troop increase that the Bush administration hopes will restore order in the violent capital."Soldiers from the 82nd come to us ready to engage in a wide variety of operations in support of the Iraqi Baghdad Security Plan," Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the second-ranking U.S. commander in Iraq, said in a statement. "The brigade adds operational flexibility that will assist in securing the population."U.S. military officials said Sunday that they could not discuss the attack in Karbala in detail because it remained under investigation. But they said the version of events provided by the governor\'s office was consistent with their preliminary findings.After arriving at the Provincial Joint Coordination Center in Karbala, 60 miles southwest of Baghdad, the attackers detonated sound bombs, Iraqi officials said. "They wanted to create a panic situation," said an aide to Karbala Gov. Akeel al-Khazaali, who described the events with the governor\'s permission but on condition of anonymity because he fears reprisals.The men then stormed into a room where Americans and Iraqis were making plans to ensure the safety of thousands of people expected to visit the holy city for an upcoming holiday."They didn\'t target anyone but the American soldiers," the governor\'s aide said.After the attack, the assailants returned to their vehicles and drove away. It was unclear how many people participated, and the men\'s identities and motive remained unclear, but the attack was particularly striking because of the resources and sophistication involved, Iraqi officials said.The men drove off toward the city of Babil, north of Karbala, where they shot at guards at a checkpoint, said Capt. Muthana Ahmad, a police spokesman. Vehicles later recovered contained three bodies and one injured individual. The U.S. military took possession of the vehicles, the spokesman said.Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had a surprise for President Bush when they sat down with their aides in the Four Seasons Hotel in Amman, Jordan. Firing up a PowerPoint presentation, Maliki and his national security adviser proposed that U.S. troops withdraw to the outskirts of Baghdad and let Iraqis take over security in the strife-torn capital. Maliki said he did not want any more U.S. troops at all, just more authority.The president listened intently to the unexpected proposal at their Nov. 30 meeting, according to accounts from several administration officials. Bush seemed impressed that Maliki had taken the initiative, but it did not take him long to reject the idea.By the time Bush returned to Washington, the plan had already been picked through by his military commanders. At a meeting in the White House\'s Roosevelt Room, the president flatly told his advisers that the Maliki plan was not going to work. He had concluded that the Iraqis were not up to the task and that Baghdad would collapse into chaos, making a bad situation worse. And so the Americans would have to help them.From that early December meeting on, Bush was headed down a path that would result in his defying critics and the seeming message of the November elections by ordering 21,500 more U.S. troops to Iraq. A reconstruction of the administration\'s Iraq policy review, based on more than a dozen interviews with senior advisers, Bush associates, lawmakers and national security officials, reveals a president taking the lead in driving the process toward one more effort at victory -- despite doubts along the way from his own military commanders, lawmakers and the public at large.He never seriously considered beginning to withdraw U.S. forces, as urged by newly elected Democratic congressional leaders and the bipartisan Iraq Study Group. And he had grown skeptical of his own military commanders, who were telling him no more troops were needed.So Bush relied on his own judgment that the best answer was to try once again to snuff out the sectarian violence in Baghdad, even at the risk of putting U.S. soldiers into a crossfire between Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias. When his generals resisted sending more troops, he seemed irritated. When they finally agreed to go along with the plan, he doubled the number of troops they requested.It was a signature moment for a president who seems uninfluenced by the electorate on Iraq and headed for a showdown with the new Democratic Congress. Presented with an opportunity to pull back, Bush instead chose to extend and, in some ways, deepen his commitment, gambling that more time and a new plan will finally bring success to the troubled U.S. military mission."The guy who is most committed to winning and finding a way to win is the president. He always has been; he\'s the only reason we are still in this fight," said Frederick W. Kagan, a military historian at the American Enter',

    text: 'John 5-8. In the "Shepherd" of Hermas 38.10 (Mand. 8.10) hospitality is distinctly mentioned in the catalogue of virtues, with this remarkable comment: ἐν γὰρ τῇ φιλοξενίᾳ εὑρίσκεται ἀγαθοποίησίς ποτε ("for benevolence from time to time is found in hospitality"), while in 76.3 (Sim. 8.10.3), praise is assigned to those Christians who ἡδέως εἰς τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν ὑπεδέξαντο τοὺς δούλους τοῦ θεοῦ ("gladly welcomed God\'s servants into their houses"). Aristides, in his Apology (15.7), says that if Christians "see any stranger, they take him under their roof and rejoice over him as over a very brother" (ξένον ἐὰν ἴδωσιν ὑπὸ στέγην εἰσάγουσι καὶ χαίρουσιν ἐπ’ αὐτῷ ὡς ἐπὶ ἀδελφῷ ἀληθινῷ).The exercise of hospitality by private individuals towards Christian brethren is assumed by Tertullian to be a duty which no one dare evade; for, in writing to his wife (ad Uxor. 2.4), he warns her against marrying a heathen, should he (Tertullian) predecease her, on the ground that no Christian brother would get a spiritual reception in an alien household. But hospitality was inculcated especially upon officials of the church, such as elders (bishops) and deacons, who practiced this virtue in the name of the church at large; cp. 1 Tim. 3.2, Tit. 1.8 (1 Tim. 5.10). In Hermas 104.2 (Sim. 9.27.2) hospitable bishops form a special class among the saints, since "they gladly received God\'s servants into their houses at all times, and without hypocrisy." In [[178b]] the Didache a comparatively large amount of space is taken up with directions regarding the care of travelers, and Cyprian\'s interest in strangers is attested by his seventh letter, written to his clergy at Carthage from his place of retreat during the Decian persecution. He writes: "I beg you will attend carefully to the widows, and sick people, and all the poor. You may also pay the expenses of any strangers who may be in need, out of my own portion which I left with my fellow-presbyter Rogatianus. In case it should be all used, I hereby forward by the hands of Naricus the acolyte another sum of money, so that the sufferers may be dealt with more promptly and liberally" ("Vίduαrum et infirmorum et omnium pauperum curam peto diligenter habeatis, sed et peregrinis si qui indigentes fuerint sumptus suggeratis de quantitate mea propria quam apud Rogatianum compresbyterum nostrum dimisi. Quae quantitas ne forte iam erogata sit, misi eidem per Naricum acoluthum aliam portionem, ut largius et promptius circa laborantes fiat operatio"). Cp. also Apost."Peregrinus thus started out for the second time, and betook himself to traveling; he had an ample allowance from the Christians, who constituted themselves his bodyguard, so that he lived in clover. Thus for some time he provided for himself in this fashion." From the pseudo-Clementine epistle de Virginitate one also learns to appreciate the appeal and exercise of hospitality. Finally, Julian (Ep. ad Arsac.) emphasizes ἡ περὶ τοὺς ξένους φιλανθρωπία among Christians, and wishes that his own party would imitate it (see above, p. 162).It was easy to take advantage of a spirit so obliging and [[180]] unsparing (e.g., the case of Proteus Peregrinus, and especially the churches\' sad experience of so-called prophets and teachers). Heretics could creep in, and so could loafers or impostors. We note, accordingly, that definite precautions were taken against these at quite an early period. The new arrival is to be tested to see whether or not he is a Christian (cp. 2 and 3 John; Did.Passport from his church at home. Things must have come to a sad pass when (as the Didache informs us) it was decreed that any visitor must be adjudged a false prophet without further ado, if during an ecstasy he ordered a meal and then partook of it, or if in an ecstasy he asked for money. Many a traveler, however, who desired to settle down, did not come with empty hands; such persons did not ask, they gave. Thus we know (see above) that when Marcion came from Pontus and joined the Roman church, he contributed 200,000 sesterces to its funds (Tert., de Praescr. 30).Cor. 12.26). And there is no doubt whatever that the consciousness of this was most vigorous and vital [[181]] in the very ages during which no external bond as yet united the various churches, the latter standing side by side in almost entire independence of each other. These were the ages when the primitive article of the common symbol, "I believe in one holy church," was really nothing more than an article of faith. And of course the effect of the inward ties was all the stronger when people were participating in a common faith which found expression ere long in a brief and vigorous confession, or practicing the same love and patience and Christian discipline, or turning their hopes in common to that glorious consummation of Christ\'s kingdom of which they had each received the earnest and the pledge.Poverty, sickness, persecution, and suffering of all kinds formed one class of troubles which demanded constant help on the part of churches that were better off; while, in a different direction, assistance was required in those internal crises of doctrine and of conduct which might threaten a church and in fact endanger its very existence. Along both of these lines the brotherly love of the churches had to prove its reality.It was a Gentile Christian church which was the first, so far as we are aware, to help a sister church in her distress. Shortly after this, the brotherly love felt by young Christian communities drawn from pagans in Asia and Europe is reported to have approved itself on a still wider scale. Even after the famine had passed, the mother church at Jerusalem continued poor. Why, we do not know. An explanation has been sought in the early attempt by which that church is said to have introduced a voluntary community of goods; it was the failure of this attempt, we are to believe, that left the local church impoverished. This is merely a vague conjecture. Nevertheless, the poverty at Jerusalem remains a fact. At the critical conference in Jerusalem, when the three pillar-apostles definitely recognized Paul\'s mission to the Gentiles, the latter pledged himself to remember the poor saints at Jerusalem in distant lands; and the epistles to the Galatians, the Corinthians, and the Romans, show how widely and faithfully the apostle discharged this obligation. His position in this matter was by no means easy. He had made himself responsible for a collection whose value depended entirely on the voluntary devotion of the churches which he founded.Corinth being endangered by a severe local crisis, he did not fail to remember the business of the collection along with more important matters. The local arrangements for it had almost come to a standstill by the time he wrote, and the aim of his vigorous, affectionate, and graceful words of counsel to the church is to revive the zeal which had been allowed to cool amid their party quarrels (2 Cor. 8.9). Not long afterwards he is able to tell the Romans that "those of Macedonia and Achaia freely chose to make a certain contribution for the poor saints at Jerusalem. They have done it willingly, and indeed it was a debt. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to minister to them in secular things"Neither statement explains if it was only members of the particular church in question who were thus supported. This, however, is inherently improbable, and there are express statements to the contrary, including one from a pagan source.Christians about the year 170: "From the very first you have had this practice of aiding all the brethren in various ways and of sending contributions to churches in manyevery city, thus in one case relieving the poverty of the needy, or in another providing for brethren in the mines. By these gifts, which you have sent from the very first, you Romans keep up the hereditary customs of the Romans, a practice your bishop Soter has not merely maintained but even extended." A hundred years later Dionysius, the bishop of Alexandria, in writing to Stephen the bishop of Rome, has occasion to mention the churches in Syria and Arabia. Whereupon he remarks in passing, "To them you send help regularly, and you have just [[185]] written them another letter"Cyprian. From a number of letters written shortly before his execution, it is quite clear that Cyprian sent money to provide for the Christians who then lay captive in Numidia (Ep. 76-79), and elsewhere in his correspondence there is similar evidence of his care for stranger Christians and foreign churches. The most memorable of his letters, in this respect, is that addressed to the bishops of Numidia in 253 C.E.The latter had informed him that wild hordes of robbers had invaded the country and carried off many Christians of both sexes into captivity. Whereupon Cyprian instituted a collection on their behalf and forwarded the proceeds to the bishops along with the following letter (Ep.Paul: Should one member suffer, all the others suffer along with it; and should one member rejoice, the others rejoice with it also. And in another place he says: Who is weak, and I am not weak? We must therefore consider the present imprisonment of our brethren as our imprisonment, reckoning the grief of those in peril as our grief. We form a single body in our union, and we ought to be stirred and strengthened by religious duty as well as by love to redeem our members the brethren."For as the apostle Paul once more declares: Know ye not that ye are God\'s temple and that the Holy Spirit dwelleth in you? Though love failed to stir us to succor the brethren, we must in this case consider that it is temples of Go',

    text: "With regards to Saudi Arabia, the ruling system is monarchial which contradicts Islam. Article 5(a) of the constitution states, \"The system of government in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is that of a monarchy.\"The economic solutions also contradict Islam on a number of different levels. With respect to oil we find that it is not public property but is largely privately owned, which is the case in Saudi Arabia - Aramco.We also find that economic solutions are dervied from free market thinking, which is evident in the privatisation process in Iran. The problem here is with the basis of thinking. Islam specifies what is public, private and state ownership. Iran is going from one extreme to another, from nationalisation to privatisation.I ask this because I consider respectful peer-based relationships and constructive coexistence across ethnic, religious, class, etc. lines to be *the* toughest challenge to democracy; people of like mind can and do establish some very smoothly operating communities on small (sub-national) scales, but there seems to be a size limit and it appears to be closely related to considerations of how large a group one can find where most of the people are an ideological match.We live *today* under a global economic regime which continually redistributes wealth...UPWARD.  This regime is very much based upon massive and routine violence, both through state and non-state actors.Muslims seem to follow the same pattern as adherents of other faiths when it comes to politicoeconomic systems, i.e. you have a handful of people who stick up for economic justice within any faith, but the majority take the windvane approach and just go along with whatever regime is dominant.In Islam we can see things like Ramadan, which involve clear appeals to consider the plight of the poor.  In Christianity we have things like the \"eye of the needle\" passage and a host of callings to transcend the temporal world of earthly possessions in favor of spiritual wealth.  In Judaism there is the notion of healing the world...and so on for every major faith community I can think of.However, the overwhelming majority of adherents to each of these faiths seems perfectly content to settle for piecemeal gestures towards economic justice while tolerating (if not openly celebrating and participating in) inherently exploitative and violent economic regimes.The minority who stick up for the oppressed are what makes it possible for me to see some worth in religion...while the majority who don't are what inspires me to maintain a general suspicion of the integrity of their faith.I'm jumping in late because I've been out of town. I have a review copy of New Civ. It's a good looking magazine and I admire its goal of fostering dialogue. It makes some interesting points and, I think, dubious ones. Generally I'm wondering if, given its attempt to be steadfastly grounded in Islam, it can have much appeal beyond the Islamic community. I also wonder how representative of modern Islamic thought it is. Is it really offering me a window into the thinking of a significant portion of the non-western intellectual world?So, before we take a step further in the argument we're encountering considerable problems -- the existence of God et al. But I'm willing to go along with the premise just to see how the argument turns out.\"Rather Islam views people in their capacity as human beings and citizens of the Islamic State. So no differentiation is made between Muslims and non-Muslims, both are viewed in their capacity as human beings and are treated as such by the Islamic rules.\"This is, I suppose, an admirable attempt to embrace diversity but it's chock full of problems when you think it through. Imagine the ideal Islamic State exists. Could non-muslims (and by non-muslims I mean those who reject Allah, the Quran as a miracle, Mohammed as the prophet and the legitimacy of Islamic Law) really have a significant place in the Caliphate? Wouldn't the system be intrinsically biased toward Islamic beliefs, making it extremely difficult for someone who did not accept them to assume a position of authority?As my limited understanding of Islam, I see an \"inner self\" way, an intuitive divine truth of the individual very similar to the native American Iroquois where The Creator speak to individual hearts, prayerful, meditative hearts of average people. From reading these postings I feel conformation for this view. It's a good place to start building bridges of understanding... and healthy economies.I have always been impressed at how Islam has specific controls on rates of return on loans and not requiring payments out when there are no profits made. I wish I could put my humble checking account into a bank with this kind of ethic.I tend to take these things as a given because economic thinking and solutions are derived from a capitalist context. That is to say we find that there are different interpretations and models of capitalism but nonetheless these models in their generality are the same but differ in the specifics. The economies of Europe and America differ on many issues especially areas of social justice where socialism has a much stronger influence upon European economics than it does in America.\"Our third great task is to spread democracy and freedom throughout the world. I spoke earlier of the grave setbacks to democracy in the first half of the 20th century. The second half of the century saw an advance of democracy that was far more dramatic. In the last quarter of that century, the number of democracies in the world tripled. And in the last six months of this new century alone, we have witnessed the peaceful, democratic transfer of power in Malaysia, a majority Muslim nation, and in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest Muslim population. We have seen men and women wait in line for hours to vote in Afghanistan's first ever free and fair presidential election.\"\"We also must realize that America and all free nations are facing a generational struggle against a new and deadly ideology of hatred that we cannot ignore. We need to do much more to confront hateful propaganda, dispel dangerous myths, and get out the truth. We will increase our exchanges with the rest of the world. And Americans should make a serious effort to understand other cultures and learn foreign languages. Our interaction with the rest of the world must be a conversation, not a monologue. And America must remain open to visitors and workers and students from around the world, without compromising our security standards. If our public diplomacy efforts are to succeed, we cannot close ourselves off from the world. And if I am confirmed, public diplomacy will be a top priority for me and for the professionals I lead.\"IMHO  \"Western\" and \"Islamic\" civilizations are more similar than not, and may there be mercy on any other civilizations that lay in their path. Both are coated with no shortage of destructive tendencies while sharing the immediate painful mutual need for an equitable 'social index'.Farooq, I think your response to my puzzlement is a fairly accurate characterization of the US position.  The problem to which I was alluding, though, is that I think the US position has generally been misguided.  I say so mainly because a survey of what routinely takes place in developing nations ought to be seen as convincing evidence that trying to impose democracy on a people who are living in utter abject poverty is ALSO a recipe for disaster, as the sheer number of coups in sub-Saharan Africa in the past, say, 50 years, clearly demonstrates.It takes time and patience to develop democracy to the point where the masses can benefit from it.  And time and patience are difficult to come by among people who are hungry.  Democracy requires stability in order to take root, and there can be no stability among a population that is suffering from an array of ills that plague the underdeveloped world, such as lack of food, lack of access to clean water, disease, etc.  That's the reason why many development economists believe that development must occur first before democracy.  Hungry people don't care about capitalism versus socialism.  They just want to eat.  Once they and their children are fed, clothed, sheltered, and healthy, they can then begin to think about what type governance they believe will be best for them in the long run.It is absurd that a nation that isn't a democracy itself could, let alone would, attempt to work for democracy elsewhere.  There are plenty of individuals and groups who strive for substantive democracy, but (suprise!) they don't work from within a state apparatus.It is even more absurd that democracy, which by its most fundamental definition is based upon true reflection of the political will of the people, could ever be imposed from without (though once again, that's clearly NOT what is even being attempted).  Even in those circumstances where (arguably) most people in a particular society truly do want substantive democracy, it must be spearheaded and achieved by the people themselves.  Potential outside allies can help *when invited*, but not otherwise.Making a fetish of the *superficial procedural* sense of \"democracy,\" in which the mere presence or absence of formal voting mechanisms is the litmus test (regardless of whether or not such voting actually DOES anything substantive to/for the de facto policies of a regime) is an insulting trivialization of democracy.  Substantive democracy does require some kind of mechanism for people to express their political will, but expression without effect is only marginally less coercive and repressive a situation than barring political expression outright.Since the 1860's when U.S. Army suppliers took over the government and created a deficit spending/tax everyone, military industrial complex, Big Business Interests have used \"democratic freedom\" rhetoric to pull the wool over the world's as well as the Am",

    text: "I think a second factor that accounts for the great satisfaction reported -- and, of course, I have to say this is self-reported, so, you know, I can't say J.D. Powers said this, but there's a dearth of other information.Nonetheless, I think that one of the reasons that we've been so successful is that our operators and our passengers have a willingness to negotiate the experience, which is to say that the very concerns that Don Backe just mentioned have been made a matter of conversation between the prospective passenger and the prospective carrier, and they've worked it out, and quite apparently to everyone's satisfaction.There's a saying that there are only three rules to seamanship, okay: you keep the water on the outside, you keep the people on the inside, and you keep the boat off the land. Anything after that's gravy.Well, you can say the same thing about surveying the disabled population in vessels. You get them on the boat safely, you give them the best experience you can that's as close as possible to what everybody else gets, and you get them off the boat safely. Cucharacha, that's it. The rest of it's details.And the fact of it is we have been doing that. I think the major problem with that option, though, is this inevitable tendency to start getting down and saying, well, you know, we need to be more specific about this and say that a person needs to be put on in thus and such a way. Or, you know, the more specific those performance recommendations become, the more and more they begin to look like what? They begin to look like the C&T rules in option 2.In option 4, I think, basically, there is no magic number when it comes to passengers. The fact of it is, as Paul pointed out, we inherited this, obviously, to some extent arbitrary line from the Coast Guard and from their relatively recently overhauled framework of vessel classification.I have to say that, even though it was not purpose made for us, it does, I think, reflect some very valuable characteristics, some of which are economically driven and some of which are feasible or infeasible as a matter of physics.The fact of it is you are never going to find a 51-passenger cruise ship. It just is never going to happen because it's not economically feasible. You are probably not going to find a 60-passenger cruise ship. I mean, at some point, you know, there is a number there where economic feasibility makes it possible.And, likewise, I think that what this really points to is that probably more important than some sort of arbitrary number of passengers are the programmatic aspects of what the vessel does, all right, because that is also going to be interrelated with the physical thing.It's very unlikely that you're going to find a 5,000-person sailing ship. It's very unlikely you're going to find a 50-person cruise ship. Okay? So, as predictors go, you know, the size and the number of people have to be taken with the actual intended design of the vessel. And, once again, I think we did that pretty well.And what I'm going to bring to you today are three issues that I'd like you to consider. And I'll give you a brief background, and then I'll get out of here. The access from vessel to shore of 1 and 12, the exemptions for that or the exceptions for that are critical in our operation, and I'll come back and talk about that later. And, by the way, I do appreciate all the work that the Passenger Vessel Access committee did. It was really good work.Three is where we'll lead a little bit away from our Passenger Vessel Association. We feel that -- Casco Bay Island Transit District feels that the demarcation line is arbitrary at 150 passengers. There should be a subchapter, a super K or 600 passengers would be more realistic. Our little ferries, although they seem big to some, it's very difficult in the environment we operate in to meet all of the requirements.But let me just go over and tell you very quickly about our operation. I think one of the things I'm proudest of, the Casco Bay Island Transit District came into being in 1982 when the bankrupt Casco Bay Lines went into receivership. And, starting in 1984, we've had a record of every time we've dealt with the boat we've tried to improve its accessibility. We've never denied anybody transportation. We help everybody on and off the boat. We have two deckhands at the gangway any time we're operating.And, in 1985, we designed our first ferry, made sure it had handicapped accessible heads, an area for wheelchairs. In 1987, when the ferry terminal was built, we made sure it met all the requirements.In 1994, when we built our first passenger boat, we had an elevator between decks. So, a 399 passenger boat, we put an elevator between decks. In 1998, we retrofitted the Island Romance, a 65-foot boat. We couldn't put an elevator in it because the boat was too small, but we did put a lift in it. We call it a passenger lift. I'm not quite sure where that fits between a lulu and a platform lift, but we put a passenger lift in there.Our new boat that is currently under construction, the Aucocisco III, is replacing a 38-year-old ferry, the Island Holiday. And, once the Board and staff came to visit us, we submitted our plans and asked for and consequently made changes in the design of the boat to try and make it more accessible.So, I mean, our effort has been to try to make our operation accessible, and it's not for all altruistic reasons. I think it's the right thing to do, but I think it's good business sense. The thing I'm asking for today is that we keep everything realistic.Our tidal range is upwards of 14 feet. We have to operate the fixed piers. We cannot put floats in. They get blown away. Any time we have any kind of severe weather, anybody who is operating on all floats, they're hurting in Maine.In our case, we have fixed piers on the islands; we don't have steel vessels. We have a fixed facility in Portland. When we looked at designing the ferry terminal to put a ramp that would meet the 1 and 12 at the ferry terminal, it would start at the waterside and run through our entire building and be out as far as the parking lot. And I don't say that to be humorous. I'm just telling you, that's the kind of conditions we're having to deal with in Maine. And, again, what we try to do is we've designed and worked with the Maine Department of Transportation as they built the fixed docks and the down bay islands. It used to be that you just had a top level, and then a midrange or a low level.We've actually put in intermittent level ramps so that we can actually meet the standard about half the time. But the other half of the time, we won't be close to meeting the standard if it were required to remain at 1 and 12.The other exception is the so-called grandfathering. And, again, I want to tell you that operations like ours are going to try every way we can to continue to keep our boats accessible, but I'm concerned about whether we'd be required, if we did any major alterations to one of our smaller boats, that we'd have to put an elevator in it, as opposed to a passenger lift. From a stability standpoint and a space standpoint, it would be very difficult.We have a little concern about also our car ferry that we built in 1985 that we put accessible heads and areas for wheelchairs to be located and assistance to be able to sit by them. We did that back in 1985. That is a three-deck boat. It does not have an elevator to either the second or third deck. That would be a major concern if we did something of major alteration where we'd have to put an elevator on that boat. There's just no room on it right now. But I just want to make sure that I got that mentioned.The last, and probably the most difficult maybe for you, and I've been told this is the hardest nut to crack, is the idea of the arbitrariness of establishing a 150 passenger limit for small versus large.And it's difficult to think of the idea that only through the mastery of the naval architecture profession that you could actually cram 300 people on this boat. It's actually a small boat. So we would encourage you to at least consider that.I'll be glad to answer any questions. I have my comments that I'll pass along to staff and then we'll, of course, make our written comments. We do want to echo the statement made by Ed Welch that any extension of time, especially if we get 60 or 90 days beyond the current I guess it's March 28 deadline, would be helpful because we spent a lot of time trying to read the regulations. I can't pretend to tell you that I really understand them or the impact of them, but we would like to have a little more time to think through this. Questions?Anyway, Chesapeake Region Accessible Boating, we go by the acronym CRAB, and I am the big crab or the head crab. But my interest has been basically in sailing craft and basically in the smaller sailing craft. And my participation in this committee represented that interest, and my interjections came from that perspective. And I think you need to know that.Some things need to be said about sailing craft which are different about these large vessels. I'm delighted to go on a large princess-style ship because it is just hunky dory compared to the challenges we face with smaller craft and sailing craft.Sailing craft, in a way, are quite a challenge for people with mobility impairments particularly because balance is important. And, if you think about it, sailing craft are asked to do things that your power craft are not.For instance, one of the absolute facts of sailing craft, especially monohulls -- that's sailing -- single-hulled sailing watercraft -- is that they heel. So, in fact, if they're small, the minute you step on them, they're out of ADA. They're bobbing up and down at the dock. They're perilous just getting on them, especially if the day is rough. So the dynamics are very challenging to people with mobility impairments.I have -- my first 52 years of my life I was able-bodie",

    text: "Such congressional accountability and periodic fiscal reform concerning national borrowing and the debt are crucial features of the fiscal constitution because although the United States is at this time capable of servicing its enormous national debt, recent trends towards inefficient and excessive borrowing portend future economic difficulties if left unchecked. Specifically, whereas the United States once borrowed only occasionally, in order to finance emergencies or its own expansion-i.e., to fund wars, pull itself out of economic depression, or invest in its own infrastructure[12]-in the last several decades it has been borrowing on a consistent annual basis simply to pay the overall cost of programs authorized by Congress and the President. Thus, the last thirty years have seen sustained growth not only in the size of the national debt, but in its proportion relative to the Gross National Product (GNP) and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).[13] As the proportion of debt to GNP/GDP has increased, *** Top of Page 138 *** so too has the \"debt servicing burden\"-i.e., the percentage of the GDP and government revenue spent servicing the national debt.[14] If this trend continues, the American people will be forced to give up more and more of their income in order to pay interest to their (in many cases overseas)[15] creditors, which in turn will lead to a persistent decline in the dollar's international value and, therefore, purchasing power.[16] Indeed, no less an authority than Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has expressed concern about future debt-to-GDP ratios and a consequent decline in living standards if national borrowing continues on its current path.[17] The debt limit statute plays a vital role in this context because although its existence has not stopped the trend towards increased borrowing, it has slowed that trend by acting as a catalyst for budget-reform and budget-balance measures aimed at reducing national borrowing.In order to appreciate the enduring need for the debt limit statute, it is necessary first to understand the evolution of Congress's borrowing and debt repayment practices-i.e., the evolution of our national debt. Part I of this Article briefly explores the nation's history of debt incurrence and repayment, including adoption of the debt limit statute in 1917 and subsequent modifications to its operation. Part II elucidates the constitutional and institutional role played by the debt limit statute in the deliberative process concerning national borrowing and debt. Part III discusses criticisms leveled at the debt limit and demonstrates that they both exaggerate actual experiences under the debt limit statute and fail to appreciate the statute's beneficial effects.Since the inception of the United States in 1789, Congress has given the Secretary of the Treasury substantial authority over monetary policy, including the issuance and repayment of debt instruments.[20] But while Congress initially maintained significant control over the conditions under which national debt could be incurred, over time it increasingly has *** Top of Page 140 *** delegated even this authority to the Treasury Secretary.[21] Further, although Congress and the Executive followed a careful fiscal policy of balanced budgets and peacetime debt repayment for the first 150-odd years of the nation's history, they have allowed serial deficits and continuing debt expansion for the last sixty-plus years. The historical evolution of the United States' debt can be broken down into roughly three periods: 1789-1917, when debt was incurred exclusively to pay for wars and to sustain the economy during a recession, but paid down immediately upon return to peace and prosperity; 1917-1946, when Congress passed the debt limit statute granting the Treasury standing borrowing authority, but continued to manage debt incurrence and repayment in substantially the same manner as before; and 1946 to the present, when changed attitudes towards debt and the debt limit have produced sustained peacetime deficits and virtually no debt reduction.Section A of this Part describes Congress's approach to debt issuance and payment prior to 1917. Section B examines the Second Liberty Bond Act (the debt limit statute) and the manner in which it delegates some of Congress's control over borrowing to the Treasury Secretary. Section C explores the shift in how Congress and the nation have used debt since the 1960s as well as the changing role of the debt limit statute in fiscal policymaking over the past forty years.As the following historical analysis reveals, the details and philosophy of congressional management of the national debt have changed dramatically in the course of our nation's history. But significantly, even as our national economy, debt incurrence, and repayment practices have developed, the debt limit statute has given Congress a forum for periodic assessment, criticism, and reform of national borrowing policy, and has forced Congress and the President to be publicly accountable for their borrowing decisions.Thus, from 1789 to 1917, Congress's approach to debt was conservative. Although the government was unafraid to incur debt, it preferred to meet its expenses with tariff and tax revenue, and borrowed only when faced with the exigent circumstances of war or economic recession. Moreover, once these exigencies abated, Congress immediately began to pay down and reduce the debt it had incurred.Thus, although the original debt limit statute granted the Treasury Secretary standing authority to borrow and eliminated congressional control over some of the more minute details of debt issuance, Congress continued to maintain a heavy hand in supervising the particulars of national borrowing under this first iteration of the statute.Despite this unprecedented string of deficits, congressional action under the debt limit statute from World War I through World War II remained substantially similar to its previous approach to national borrowing. Although the absolute amount and duration of debt incurrence during this period was staggering, such borrowing remained consistent with the old consensus that debt could and should be incurred in times of war and economic depression. In fact, the only deviation from prior norms was the government's creation of new program spending in the midst of the depression (although it was not new for outlays to increase during a depression, such increases never before had been so steady and sharp,[85] nor had they been the result of deliberate government expansion of program spending).Thus, whereas Congress in the 1960s came to view legislation increasing the statutory debt limit as inevitable, in the 1970s it came to view such legislation as a painful, if necessary, evil from which political cover was required.Bush's efforts to fund a massive war on terror without raising taxes-and while in fact cutting taxes[145]-portend exponential expansion of the national debt, particularly when viewed against the national history and precedent of paying for major wars with a combination of tax increases and federal borrowing, rather than federal borrowing alone.While such criticism is not entirely without merit, it derives from a superficial understanding of the statute's operation. Upon careful evaluation, it is clear that the statute retains enduring value. First, the statute plays a constitutionally necessary role in effecting congressional control and accountability over borrowing and the national debt.I, Section 8, Clauses 1 (\"to pay the Debts\") and 2 (\"to borrow Money on the credit of the United States\").[148] On its face, the first imposes a fiscal obligation on Congress while the second confers broad fiscal authority. But as with many provisions in our Constitution of limited federal powers, this is not all that the clauses dictate or demand. Inherent in the clauses' language is a sense of balance, of congressional control and accountability for national borrowing and the debt it creates. From these clauses, we can derive three principles of congressional borrowing and debt payment.First, a Principle of Regulated Borrowing: Congress has the power to regulate the terms and conditions under which the nation borrows funds. The power to borrow money encompasses power to regulate the terms on which the money will be borrowed-e.g., to fix interest rates, loan format, maturity dates, and to decide from whom the government shall borrow. Indeed, during the early years of our nation's history, it was established that Congress's power to borrow included the incidental power to incorporate a national bank from whom it would borrow, thereby creating conditions under which national borrowing could take place safely and efficiently.[149] The Principle of Regulated Borrowing also entails congressional control over the terms on which the government repays its debt.Second, a Principle of Borrowing and Debt Control: It is Congress's prerogative and duty to decide how much the nation will borrow and for what purposes. The power to borrow money would be merely administrative if it did not entail control over the amount and basis for borrowing. Thus, inherent in the power to borrow is an obligation, as the branch most closely connected to the populous, to exercise judgment in deciding when and under what circumstances to commit the nation and the public to indebtedness.In addition, the structure of Article I, Section 8 implies that Congress is to be accountable to the people regarding its decisions about national borrowing and repayment of the debt with which it saddles the nation. The first clause of Article I, Section 8 confers both the power to tax and the power to pay debts; the power to borrow is conferred immediately thereafter, in the section's second clause. This structure is no accident.The three powers are listed together because they are interrelated. As noted above, the founding fathers created the power to ",

Redesigning a well in progress will often result in a poor plan because of late notice and insufficient time to work on the problems. Often, risk analysis is based on drilling history, which can mask serious risks in your current project. Inconsistent risk assessment processes fail to identify the primary cause of costly drilling problems: stuck pipe, kicks, and losses. These problems lead to significant nonproductive time (NPT) and cost overruns. At the same time, E&P companies face growing pressure to reduce drilling costs, while fewer engineers are drilling increasingly difficult wells.Using this breakthrough technology, engineers throughout your organization will better understand and manage risks, deliver more accurate cost estimates, reduce NPT, and avoid costly drilling problems.The Osprey Risk prediction model is the first E&P software application that incorporates earth-property data to estimate drilling risk and cost. You can rapidly test well design concepts and easily evaluate various cost estimates, taking into consideration trade-offs to balance rate of penetration versus stuck pipe and kicks. Results of Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic analysis show the full range of possible time and costs, providing you with a better understanding of your schedule risk and financial exposure. By automatically assigning time and cost to all phases of the well operation, the Osprey Risk model provides accurate estimates for budgetary purposes with greater consistency, reducing the time your engineers spend on cost estimation.Automatically created reports highlight trouble zones and indicate the severity of potentially high-impact risks. With this information, drilling engineers can focus their time on mitigating critical risks. Additional reports present detailed engineering results, including an editable operational activity plan that can be used to benchmark rig activities or for technical limit exercises.The well-on-a-page summary and well-engineering montage can be used for peer reviews or as drilling roadmaps. The probabilistic authorization for expenditure (AFE) makes it easy to create the required documentation for internal approval and project sanctioning. The drilling program can be created with summary charts, tables, and text, dramatically improving the efficiency and productivity of your engineers.Petrel seismic-to-simulation software offers collaborative visualization on the desktop, with modules for well path design and for quickly estimating the cost, time, and risk of proposed wells and sharing these results with the Osprey Risk application.Osprey Reports well operations reporting system uses shared operational plans, well design elements, and predicted risks for benchmarking rig activities and alerting wellsite teams to elevated risk levels.DrillDB operations performance analysis system provides the plan used for comparing actual performance and updating the equipment and performance used as the design basis within the Osprey Risk model.A unique intelligent rig-state-detection engine enables the user to accurately analyze present or postdrilling performance. Drilling performance information can be displayed in pie or bar charts, and drilling data can be assessed continuously and analyzed with the help of torque-and-drag or hydraulics models.PERFORM Toolkit software also has the unique ability to display, on the same log, synchronized time and depth data combined with a precise graphic representation of the BHA. This BHA can be built with the software or imported from other programs. Users can monitor and review any event that occurs during the drilling process and can capture events for future reference by entering comments in time or depth log risk tracks.In developing PERFORM Toolkit software, Schlumberger tapped into its years of experience with the PERFORM process and its No Drilling Surprises expertise. The result is a software package that will help drilling experts make the best use of vast amounts of real-time or recorded drilling data.The PERFORMView real-time drilling analyzer allows viewing depth- and time-based drilling and logging data in both two and three dimensions. Any event that occurs during the drilling process can be monitored and reviewed, and simple statistical analysis and data investigation can be performed.PERFORMView displays can be customized using filters suited to the application. This filtering allows rapid and accurate decision making because it shows only critical data. The software can be used to analyze either real-time or postdrilling data. Hydraulics and torque-and-drag analysis outputs of the PERFORM Toolkit software package can be viewed in real time.PERFORMView software can display drilling performance information either on crossplots or in pie or bar charts and show synchronized time and depth data combined with a precise graphic representation of the BHA, all on the same log. A lithology column with various caliper data can be displayed in the BHA track when EcoScope data is available.Advanced wellsite connectivity and remote control software enable Schlumberger Operation Support Center (OSC) personnel to remotely manage Schlumberger wellsite services. This remote management includes control of most operations for directional drilling (DD), measurement while drilling (MWD), and logging-while drilling (LWD). As a result, there are fewer personnel at the wellsite, which cuts transportation and accommodation costs and reduces health, safety, and environmental (HSE) risks.Schlumberger took the occasion of February's SPE/IADC conference in Amsterdam to formally unveil its much-anticipated Scope system, hailed by the company as the next generation of logging while drilling tools. US Editor Rick von Flatern takes a look at this latest LWD offering with an eye on what has come before.For more than 20 years, logging while drilling (LWD) technology has been making constant gains in its quest to deliver critical formation data even as the well bore is being drilled. For operators and geophysicists the attraction of the technology is a widely agreed upon principle that the fresher the well bore the better the data.With their origins in simple measurement while drilling (MWD) tools that were aimed primarily at monitoring well path trajectory, LWD tools have evolved to the point they are able to deliver formation evaluation logs of sufficient detail and accuracy to be used in c",

    text: "Assistant professor of physics Michael Pravica authored this essay, based upon a University of Nevada-Las Vegas University Forum talk and most recently presented to the Las Vegas City Council to support their passage of a resolution on global warming.Our atmosphere is comparable to a rubber glove stretched over a bowling ball -- it is very thin. Due to our atmosphere, we don't suffer the extremes of temperature of Mercury and our moon. In the opposite extreme, since our atmosphere isn't as thick or dense as Venus, we don't suffer from oppressive heat (850 Kelvin) due to greenhouse warming that prevents water from condensing there. Earth developed a very fortunate (for life) state of quasi-equilibrium. This allowed water to condense, removed most of the carbon dioxide from the air. And with liquid water as solvent, life evolved. However, human activity is probably altering this equilibrium by producing greenhouse gases (most notably carbon dioxide). These gases trap heat, warming Earth's surface and further release carbon dioxide (trapped in melting glaciers or warming oceans), further warming Earth's surface and creating a new equilibrium state in which all life may not survive. Unlike water, which readily condenses into liquid and solid (ice/snow), carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere roughly 100 years before its natural removal. Thus, any effort initiated today to reverse the warming trend will not bear fruit until decades later. Though carbon dioxide levels have cyclically varied from about 180 parts per million to 280 ppm over the last 650,000 years, we have never measured higher carbon dioxide concentrations during this period than now (370 ppm) -- roughly 27 percent higher than at any point in the Earth's \"recent\" history. Though many argue that greenhouse gas release via human activity pales by comparison with volcanoes and other geothermal releases, these events are very short term and have created problems for life in the past but were \"rapidly\" corrected.Carbon dioxide produced by all life (not including humans) may be larger than that created by human activity. But without humans, it has been in equilibrium/balance for much time via the carbon cycle. Humans continue to add enormous additional quantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and are also removing the ability of life to remove/sequester carbon dioxide (by e.g. decimating rain forests). This alters the Earth's natural homeostatic balance and it's possible we are only beginning to see the negative results. To provide some perspective of the sheer quantity of CO2 introduced, consider that a gallon of gasoline releases about 20 pounds of CO2 (among other greenhouse gases) and given that our nation consumes more than 20 million barrels of oil every day, this implies about 9 billion tons of carbon dioxide are released into the atmosphere every day. Whenever rapid change occurs, all life suffers as it struggles to adapt. The Earth's natural equilibrium can only take so many shocks before it irreversibly goes to a new state that may not support life, as in the rest of our solar system. We are conducting an experiment on our only home, Mother Earth, the results of which may not be known for some time and which may be catastrophic and irreversible.Tragically, most of the voices from whom the public have heard discuss global warming (such as author James Creighton or politician Al Gore) are not scientists and have spun (or misunderstood) the science behind this phenomenon to suit their own political or dogmatic needs. Scientists such as James Hanson who have been studying global warming for decades have been censored/muzzled by political bosses who have no little or no scientific training. Other scientists such as Peter Doran have had their data misinterpreted and misrepresented for political aims. Unfortunately for humans, there is no politics in nature but absolute natural laws. We cannot go on pretending these laws of nature don't exist and can be violated without disastrous consequences. Whether it is warming, pollution, dwindling natural resources, pestilence and disease or overpopulation, the human race is on a collision course with reality and only science can avoid likely catastrophes ahead.  In that spirit, I encourage all members of the public and their leaders to first of all learn the science behind the phenomenon of global warming and engage scientists in the debate so we can all decide together on the future course of action to tackle and prepare for global warming for the survival of the human race.At the end of the past academic year, UNLV Libraries vastly increased users' access to articles from scientific journals with the purchase of several large electronic archives from publishers Springer, Wiley, Elsevier, and the Royal Society of Chemistry.  UNLV library users now have electronic access to the entire runs of many important journals like Polymer and  Cell.  The recent purchase from Springer includes a large collection of e-books (books in digital format), many of them scientific or mathematical in nature.  These journals and books can be accessed by title through the UNLV Libraries Catalog.The College of Sciences is saddened to announce the passing of one of our colleagues, research assistant professor John Abiodun Elegbede, on August 21, 2006.  He passed away after a courageous battle in recent months with Multiple Myeloma. Elegbede was born in Nigeria, where he was the head of the biochemistry department at Amadu Bello University, Zaria. In the United States, he was an oncology researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Elegbede received his B.S. (1975) and M.S. (1978) degrees in Biochemistry from Ahmadu Belllo University in Zaria, Nigeria. He received his Ph.D. in Nutritional Sciences from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1984. Elegbede's general research interests were in the areas of nutrition and cancer. He explored the protective effects of foods of plant origin against certain human diseases. Works by Elegbede and others showed that the monoterpene d-limonene has protective effects against breast cancer and led to the development of this class of compounds for clinical trials in humans. At the time of his death, Elegbede's current research focused on the identification of other non-nutritive agents with anti-carcinogenic potential and the understanding of  mechanism(s) of action of anti-carcinogens, particularly the role of chemotherapeutic agents in the regulation of apoptosis. He was also a deacon of Green Valley Baptist Church in Las Vegas and is survived by his wife, Moyo Elegbede; son, Damilola Elegbede; and daughter, Anu Elegbede..

Officials say the curriculum will better prepare graduates for college or the workforce. Opponents of the curriculum say the extra math and science courses might frustrate students who aren't academically inclined and take time from vocational courses A Nevada university system report from 2002 showed 28 percent of Nevada high school graduates at the University of Nevada, Reno took remedial classes in at least one subject, compared with 43 percent at University of Nevada, Las Vegas.The Spring meeting of the College of Sciences Faculty included presentations from Dean Ron Yasbin and others. Among the topics covered were: introductions of new faculty members, development activities, current university search committees, college awards and by-laws, scholarship awards policies, two new courses (SCI 101 and SCI 499), class attendance, workload reassignments and committee reports.Abstract: The presentation focused on different models of gamma-ray and neutrino, of energy GeV and above, emission from GRBs. Detection/non-detection of these astronomical messengers in current and upcoming detectors may constrain the source models. He also discussed neutrino detection in ice/water Cherenkov experiments and how flavor tagging may be used to learn about astrophysics of the sources.Abstract: Surface-induced bond energy variations, computed by the NRL tight-binding (TB) method, are incorporated as an elemental interaction model in the statistical-mechanical free energy concentration expansion method (FCEM) [1]. First, segregation profiles computed for free Pt-Rh surfaces are used as a test case, yielding good agreement with reported experimental data, and highlighting the role of subsurface tensions in the emergence of oscillatory profiles even in the absence of alloy mixing tendency [2].The second part involves 923 atom cuboctahedron clusters of Pd-Cu that reveal core and surface segregated mixed-type ordering, whereas Pd-Rh tends to separate into clusters exhibiting distinct demixed order [3]. At high temperatures, the clusters exhibit atomic disordering followed by desegregation processes, all reflected in cluster-size dependent Schottky-type configurational heat capacity peaks [3,4]. Comparing Pd-Cu with Pd-Cu-Rh reveals distinct ternary alloying effects. The role of the TB computed bond energy variations in the segregation related phenomena is demonstrated.Ernesto V. Abel-Santos, Ph.D. joins the chemistry department from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where he served as assistant professor in the department of biochemistry. Abel-Santos received his Ph.D. (Biology and Biological Sciences) from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri.

    text: '"There is no place this sad morning for any discussion other than an immediate and unconditional cease-fire, as well as an international investigation into the Israeli massacres in Lebanon now," Siniora said.In the Palestinian territory, the armed wing of Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas\'s Fatah faction said today it will target the United States and other Western countries after the deadly Israeli raid on Qana.It also comes as Rice arrived in the region for talks with Israeli and Lebanese leaders on ending the violence. She had hoped to raise the possibility of deploying an international force along the border zone dividing southern Lebanon and Israel, but her chances of success -- never high -- now look remote.A Red Cross rescuer carries the body of child killed in the July 30 Israeli air strike in Qana (epa)The persistence of Israel in what he called "its heinous crimes" against Lebanese civilians would not break the will of the people. Now, he said, was the time for unity "in the face of the Israeli war criminals."France, Britain, the European Union, and Jordan are among those condemning the Qana strike. Jordan\'s King Abdullah called Qana "an ugly crime," and France has drawn up a draft UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities."We will continue with our offensive, and I want to announce that after all the time that passed and the persistence from the Israeli enemy, we reached the stage of Haifa," said Hizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah on July 25. "But now I announce that we will be entering a stage that is beyond Haifa. So, this is a new stage that the enemy has forced upon us.""Israel is determined to carry on the fight against Hizballah," said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert a day earlier. "We\'ll reach out for them; we\'ll stop them; and we will not hesitate to take the most severe measures against those who are aiming thousands of rockets and missiles against innocent civilians for one purpose -- to kill them. This is something that we will not be able to tolerate."On the one hand, popular support for Hizballah on the streets of Cairo, Amman, and Riyadh is growing. On the other hand, those countries fear Iran, and they would hate to see the Shi\'ite militants emerge from this conflict victorious.U.S. troops inspect the site of the October 1983 bombing of a military barracks in Beirut (AFP)France and Germany this week ruled out sending any soldiers on a stabilization mission to southern Lebanon, in case of a truce. French President Jacques Chirac spoke out against using NATO. He said the alliance, unfortunately, is seen in the region as "the armed wing of the West."Both the United States and France have painful memories of the last time they sent troops to Lebanon, to try to stabilize the situation, in the early 1980s. Two hundred and forty-one U.S. Marines were killed when their headquarters were bombed in Beirut in 1983. Another strike on the French multinational force headquarters killed 58 French troops. Both attacks were blamed on Hizballah militants."The civilian population remains the main victim of the prevailing security situation," Magazzeni told journalists. "Law enforcement agencies do not provide effective protection to the population of Iraq and, increasingly, miliitias and criminal gangs act in collusion with or have infiltrated the security forces.""But, of course, it is tragic when there [are] innocent civilians losing their lives in Iraq," Blair said. "You know, hundreds of thousands of them lost their lives, innocent people, under Saddam. Now, thousands of them are losing their lives, but they are losing their lives because terrorists and because internal extremists, linking up with external extremists, are killing them. It is not British and American soldiers that are killing innocent people. We are trying to protect innocent people."General George Casey did not say how many troops arrived today. He said the deployments may not yield quick results, but added that he expected the situation in Iraq to improve through the summer and fall."Together, we and the Iraqis have committed sufficient reliable security forces here to ensure that we succeed," Casey said. "And finally, as with any plan, there are no guarantees of success, and it is not going to happen overnight. But with sustained political support and the concentrated efforts on all sides, I believe that this plan can work."The roughly 90 female delegates could be spotted easily among the more than 300 members of the bicameral parliament at the opening session of the Afghan National Assembly. Twenty-seven-year-old Malalai Joya, representing the western Farah Province in the lower house, was among them.His trial started on July 31. Uzbek authorities say 187 people -- including many security officers -- died during the May 2005 antigovernment uprising in Andijon. But rights groups say troops killed hundreds of unarmed civilians."[Hasanov] called at around 18:00 [on August 11] and told me two high-ranking officers from the Interior Ministry\'s Antiterrorism and Antireligious Extremism Department sent him a driver and asked him to come [to an agreed location]," Ikramov said. "The conversation ran about me. They told Dadakhon that he should refuse my help and that my participation in his trial should stop. In exchange, they promised his sentence would be [reduced, or] commuted."After the Uzbek government indicated earlier this summer that it was interested in talks, an EU "fact-finding" mission visited Tashkent earlier this week. RFE/RL spoke on September 1 to the head of the EU delegation, Finnish diplomat Antti Turunen. Turunen indicated that the visit, although inconclusive, were promising enough for the EU to "analyze" to see if the sanctions imposed on Uzbekistan in the wake of last year\'s bloody events in Andijon could be lifted.Uzbek authorities refused to allow an independent, international inquiry into the killings, prompting the EU to impose sanctions on the country in October. The sanctions include a freeze on all political contacts, aid cuts, and visa bans on officials held responsible for the events in Andijon and their cover-up.Turunen said the EU visit took place in response to "suggestions" that Uzbekistan is willing to resume contacts. The suggestion was made by and Uzbek deputy foreign minister on a visit to Helsinki in June -- just before Finland assumed the EU presidency."They indicated [then] that there would be possibilities to again resume ministerial level dialogue, that they might be willing to again discuss all aspects of EU-Uzbek relations, including the events in Andijon," he said.The EU delegation then held a series of meetings with officials at the Ministry of Justice, representatives of the Attorney General\'s office, and Uzbek parliament members. Overall, Turunen said, the atmosphere was "rather good.""Well, it seems that at the moment the issue with the international inquiry is not on the agenda as such," he said. "They are to a certain extent open to discuss on expert level the events that took place in Andijon and we have to now see what this amounts to, what concrete steps towards that direction could be taken.""The other issue is they are now willing to engage on human rights, to establish some kind of human rights dialogue or regular meetings on human rights issues which, in itself, is a positive signal," he said.Turunen said it is not clear to the EU what has prompted the Uzbek government\'s apparent change of heart. He said the EU\'s assumption is that Uzbekistan is trying to overcome its isolation. Turunen noted the country, landlocked and far from the developed world, needs international partners for trade and investment.EU officials have said before Uzbekistan\'s energy resources could be of interest to the EU. Turunen said the issue of Uzbek energy reserves was not "directly" raised during his visit. But, he added, "one might assume in the longer run they look forward to EU investment in this area.""But, of course, there are many, many open cases on human rights, and we have to now carefully look into what has really been done and what recommendations of [the] international community have been implemented," he said. "That will be part of the assessment of the sanctions regime and on the basis of that assessment a decision on the fate of the sanctions will be made by mid-November."Turunen said that should the EU decide to lift the sanctions -- something that is far from certain at this stage -- a "Cooperation Council" meeting with Foreign Minister Norov could take place in Brussels later this autumn. Under the now mostly suspended EU-Uzbek Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the two sides held yearly ministerial-level meetings.When the Internet emerged in 1990, it brought with it hopes that it would sweep away obstacles to the free flow of information. The reality has proved more ambiguous, with a glut of information sowing confusion, a digital divide underscoring the persistence of economic inequality, and government-imposed filters limiting access.Several long-standing independent websites have recently stopped functioning. These include Tribune.uz, which posted a message to readers on July 4 informing them that the site, which has been blocked in Uzbekistan since May 2005, will cease operations; Arena, a press freedom site that has not been updated since June 2006; and Free Uzbekistan.But a number of new websites provide a forum for exiled Uzbek journalists to give their perspective on events in their homeland. Journalists whose articles appear on these sites include a number of former correspondents for the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) who have since relocated to the United States and Europe such as Galima Bukharbayeva, Yusuf Rasul, Tulqin Qoraev, and Hurmat Bobojon, as well as former BBC correspondent Matluba Azamatova. Many materials are cross-posted, appearing simultaneously on several of the sites listed belo',
